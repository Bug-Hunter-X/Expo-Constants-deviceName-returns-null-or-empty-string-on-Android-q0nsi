This bug occurs when using the Expo `Constants.deviceName` API to retrieve the device name.  In certain situations, especially on Android emulators or devices with unusual configurations, the returned value might be unexpectedly empty or null, instead of the expected device name string. This inconsistency can cause issues with device-specific logic or reporting.

```javascript
import * as Constants from 'expo-constants';

const deviceName = Constants.deviceName;
console.log('Device Name:', deviceName); // Might be null or empty
```
